// ====================
// Hardware limitations
// ====================

// There is a bug in Altera Cyclone V SoC DWC2 version 2.93a, the minimum RX FIFO is 119 words, i.e. 4*119 = 476 bytes
// In USB peripheral device mode, setting the RX FIFO size less than this will cause enumeration to fail, specifically the EP0 status out (ZLP) never completes, i.e. keeps NAKing and no transfer complete interrupt
